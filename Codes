Here we collect all known commands to send to the enforcer and what the enforcer sends back.
Codes are sent with BLE write request as byte value in the form 0x** to the handle 0x0008.
If you want to try out you can use the "nRF Connect" app on android.
Please be careful what you send to the enforcer. As we don't really know whats going on, wrong commands may brick your enforcer.
